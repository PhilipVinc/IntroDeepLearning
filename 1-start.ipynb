    "Even though, theoretically, a VJP (Vector-Jacobian product - reverse autodiff) and a JVP (Jacobian-Vector product - forward-mode autodiff) are similar—they compute a product of a Jacobian and a vector—they differ by the computational complexity of the operation. In short, when you have a large number of parameters (hence a wide matrix), a JVP is less efficient computationally than a VJP, and, conversely, a JVP is more efficient when the Jacobian matrix is a tall matrix. You can read more in the JAX [cookbook](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html#jacobian-vector-products-jvps-aka-forward-mode-autodiff) [notebook](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html#vector-jacobian-products-vjps-aka-reverse-mode-autodiff) mentioned above.\n",
